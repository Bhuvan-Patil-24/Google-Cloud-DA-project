Data Analytics and Visualization Project
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics pipeline, from data ingestion and transformation to advanced modeling and interactive dashboarding using Google Cloud's BigQuery and Looker Enterprise.

1. Problem Statement or Goal
The primary goal of this project was to establish a robust and scalable data analytics solution capable of:

Efficiently collecting and storing raw data.

Transforming raw data into meaningful, analyzable formats.

Creating a semantic layer for consistent data definitions and access.

Developing interactive dashboards and reports to provide actionable insights to stakeholders.

Enabling data activation and deeper analysis within an enterprise environment.

2. Dataset Used
The project leveraged several datasets provided as Comma Separated Values (CSV) files. These raw data files were the foundation for all subsequent data processing and analysis. Accompanying SQL scripts were used for initial data loading and subsequent transformations within the data warehouse.

3. Steps Taken
The project followed a structured approach encompassing data engineering, data modeling, and business intelligence visualization:

a. Collect, Process, and Store Data in BigQuery
Data Ingestion: The initial CSV files were ingested into Google BigQuery, Google Cloud's fully managed, serverless data warehouse. This involved creating appropriate tables in BigQuery to host the raw data.

Data Processing and Transformation: SQL codes provided alongside the CSVs were executed within BigQuery. These scripts performed various data cleaning, aggregation, and transformation tasks, preparing the raw data for analytical use. This included joining tables, creating new calculated fields, and ensuring data quality.

Data Storage: All processed and transformed data was stored persistently in BigQuery, leveraging its columnar storage and massive scalability for efficient query performance.

b. Model Dimensions and Measures Using LookML
LookML Development: A critical step involved building a semantic layer using LookML (Looker Modeling Language). This involved defining views, models, and explores, which abstract the underlying BigQuery tables into user-friendly dimensions and measures.

Data Consistency: LookML models ensured data consistency across all reports and dashboards, providing a single source of truth for business metrics and definitions.

Performance Optimization: LookML was used to define aggregations, caching policies, and other optimizations to enhance query performance for end-users.

c. Build a Dashboard Using the Looker Enterprise UI
Interactive Dashboard Creation: Utilizing the Looker Enterprise user interface, interactive dashboards were designed and built. These dashboards served as the primary interface for business users to explore data and gain insights.

Visualization Best Practices: Various visualization types (e.g., bar charts, line graphs, pivot tables, single value indicators) were employed to effectively communicate key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends.

d. Create a Report in Looker Studio
Complementary Reporting: In addition to the Looker Enterprise dashboards, a detailed report was created in Looker Studio (formerly Google Data Studio). This report provided a different perspective on the data, potentially focusing on specific time-bound analyses or executive summaries.

Custom Visualizations: Looker Studio's flexible canvas was used to design custom layouts and combine various charts and controls for a comprehensive reporting experience.

e. Analyze and Activate Your Data with Looker Enterprise
In-depth Analysis: Beyond pre-built dashboards, Looker Enterprise allowed for ad-hoc analysis and exploration, enabling users to drill down into specific data points and ask follow-up questions directly within the platform.

Data Activation: Looker's capabilities were utilized to activate data, potentially through scheduled report deliveries, alerts based on data thresholds, or integration with other business applications.

4. Screenshots of Your Dashboards
Below are the screenshots of the dashboards created as part of this project.

Description: This report focuses on key loan insights, presenting data related to loan applications, approvals, disbursements, default rates, and customer segmentation. It aids in risk assessment and loan portfolio management.

5. Challenges Faced and How They Were Overcome
Data Quality and Consistency:

Challenge: Initial CSV files sometimes contained inconsistencies, missing values, or non-standard formats, which could lead to inaccurate analysis.

Overcoming: Extensive data cleaning and transformation SQL scripts were developed and rigorously tested in BigQuery. This involved using SQL functions for data type conversion, handling NULLs, and standardizing text fields.

Optimizing BigQuery Performance for Looker:

Challenge: Large datasets in BigQuery could sometimes lead to slower query times when accessed directly by Looker, impacting user experience.

Overcoming: Implemented BigQuery partitioning and clustering on frequently queried columns. Additionally, LookML explored aggregation awareness and persistent derived tables (PDTs) to pre-aggregate data and significantly reduce query times for common requests.

Complex LookML Modeling:

Challenge: Translating complex business logic and relationships into efficient and maintainable LookML models required careful design and iteration.

Overcoming: Adopted modular LookML development practices, using extends and refinements to manage complexity. Collaborated with business users to refine definitions and ensure the semantic layer accurately reflected their needs.

Dashboard Design for User Experience:

Challenge: Creating dashboards that were not only visually appealing but also intuitive and actionable for diverse user groups.

Overcoming: Followed best practices in dashboard design, focusing on clarity, simplicity, and user-centric layouts. Incorporated feedback from initial users to iteratively improve the dashboard's usability and insight delivery.
